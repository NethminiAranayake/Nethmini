    "description": "Saint Albray is a flower-shaped cheese that comes from the Aquitaine region of France. Made with pasteurised cow's milk and ripened for 2 weeks, it slices off skilfully with each half-pound cut looking like a \"petal\". When each petal comes together around a disk, they form a hollow centre similar to a flower.",
